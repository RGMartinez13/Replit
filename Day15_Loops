#intro to while loops.
#A while loop allows your code to repeat itself based on a condition you set.
#similar to if,  as long as the answer is true, the computer will repeatedly run the code.
#while -> true -> continue, else stop.

#example, anything we need to "count".

counter = 0
while counter < 10:
  print(counter)
  counter +=1
