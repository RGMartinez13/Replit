#intro to while loops.
#A while loop allows your code to repeat itself based on a condition you set.
#similar to if,  as long as the answer is true, the computer will repeatedly run the code.
#while -> true -> continue, else stop.

#example, anything we need to "count".

counter = 0
while counter < 10:
  print(counter)
  counter +=1
  
#fix an infinite loop by:   variable +=1
#This is just saying "count to 10 by 1 each time." to make the loop end.
#if your condition is a > then you might need to -=. This will subtract from the variable instead of adding to it
