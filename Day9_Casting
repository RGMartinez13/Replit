#he way the computer will read this code is by starting with what is in brackets first ("your score"). 
#The computer thinks this is text because of the "". When we add int, we are telling the computer, "This is not text. Please convert this to a whole number." 
#Now the variable, myScore will store the answer as a number.


#sample
myScore = int(input("Your score: "))
if myScore > 100000:
  print("Winner!")
else:
  print("Try again ğŸ˜­")

#float

myPi = float(input("What is Pi to 3dp? "))
if myPi == 3.142 :
  print("Exactly!")
else:
  print("Try again ğŸ˜­")
