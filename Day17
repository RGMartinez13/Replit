#break leaves the loop completely and runs the next unindented line of code. 
#However, you may want to stop the code and start the loop from the top again. (This is ideal for building games!)


while True:
  print("You are in a corridor, do you go left or right?")
  direction = input("> ")
  if direction == "left":
    print("You have fallen to your death")
    break
  elif direction == "right":
    continue
  else:
    print("Ahh! You're a genius, you've won")


#The else statement refers to any input besides left or right (up or esc). 
#Since the user is a winner, we do not want to use break or it would say they have failed.
